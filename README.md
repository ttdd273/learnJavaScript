# Learning JavaScript

I will follow online tutorials to learn all about JavaScript. I will use this README as a way to take notes.

## Running JavaScript
All web browsers are able to run JavaScript, so you don't even need to download anything to run it.

You can make a HTML file with the script tags to write JavaScript in it.

## Comments in JavaScript
// -> inline comment 

/* */ -> multiline comment  


## Data Types and Variables
- undefined- you haven't set it to be anything yet
- null- you set it to something but it's nothing
- boolean
- string
- symbol-immutable, primitive value that's unique
- number
- object- store key value pairs

There are three keywords to declare variables 
- `var myName = "Beau"`
  - `myName = 8`
  - var keyword allows the variable to be used through the whole code
  - it's mutable
- `let ourName = "epic" `
  - let only allow you to use it in a certain scope
- `const pi = 3.14`
  - Immutable variable

## Declaring Values and Variables with Assignment Operator
It is conventional to put a semicolon to indicate end of a line, but technically not necessary. 
- `var a;`
- `var b = 2;`

The `=` sign is an assignment operator, and assigns the value on the right to the variable to the left.

`console.log` is bascially a print statement. 

`var a` will initialize the variable `a` if it's not initialized beforehand, but it is not assigned, so their values are undefined.

## Naming Variables
Variable names are also case sensitive, like many other languages.

It's conventional to use camelCase, unlike snake_case in Ocaml.

## Arithmetic With Numbers
- `var sum = 10 + 10;`
- `var difference = 45 -10`
- `var product = 8 * 10 `
- `var quotient = 66 / 33`

## Increment/Decrement Numbers
- `myVar = myVar - 1;`
Same as `myVar--` or `myVar++` for addition
